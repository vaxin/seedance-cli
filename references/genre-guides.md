| **Unboxing** | `First-person POV, hands open a luxury watch box. The watch is revealed, catching the light. Slow, deliberate hand movements. Top-down camera angle.` |
| **Macro Texture** | `Extreme macro shot of leather texture on a handbag. The camera slowly glides across the surface, highlighting the grain and stitching. Warm, soft light.` |

## 2. Lifestyle / Social Media

**Goal:** Relatable, authentic-feeling moments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

| Template | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Morning Routine** | `A young woman makes coffee in a sunlit kitchen. Handheld phone perspective, slight sway. She smiles as she sips the coffee. Warm, cozy aesthetic.` |
| **Café Scene** | `Friends laughing at a café table. The camera is placed on the table, looking up slightly. Steam rises from coffee cups. Natural, candid moment.` |
| **Beach Day** | `A person runs along the beach at sunset, their dog chasing them. Low-angle tracking shot from behind. Lens flare from the setting sun. Joyful and energetic.` |
| **Pet Interaction** | `A cat playfully bats at a string held just off-camera. Close-up on the cat, shallow depth of field. The cat is focused and curious. Soft, indoor lighting.` |

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Mode:** T2V or I2V
- **Duration:** 6-10 seconds
- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16
- **Prompt Length:** 40-60 words

- Focus on a single, clear action and emotion.
- Use style words like `UGC`, `candid`, `authentic`, `phone footage`.

## 3. Drama / Narrative

**Goal:** Cinematic storytelling with consistent characters and emotional weight.

| Template | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Suspense Corridor** | `@Image1 character reference. A man cautiously walks down a dark, narrow corridor. He holds a flashlight, its beam cutting through the darkness. The camera follows closely behind him, handheld. The only sound is his footsteps and nervous breathing.` |
| **Romantic Scene** | `@Image1 character A, @Image2 character B. A man and woman have a quiet conversation on a park bench at night. A single streetlight provides a warm key light. The camera is a static wide shot, letting the moment breathe. They look at each other and smile.` |
| **Action Intro** | `@Image1 character reference. A woman sits at a bar, stirring her drink. She glances towards the door, her expression hardening. The camera slowly pushes in on her face. Moody, noir lighting. The background is out of focus.` |

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Mode:** I2V or R2V (with character images)
- **Duration:** 10-15 seconds
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 or 2.35:1
- **Prompt Length:** 60-100 words

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Character consistency is the biggest challenge. Use `@Image` references for every character in every shot.
- Don't cram too much plot into one clip. Focus on a single beat or emotional shift.
- Use the `seedance-interview` skill to develop the narrative before prompting.

## 4. Music Video

**Goal:** Visually dynamic clips that sync with an audio track.

| Template | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Beat Sync** | `@Image1 artist, @Audio1 track. The artist performs in a neon-lit warehouse. Quick cuts sync to the drum beat at 120 BPM. Whip pans and snap zooms on the chorus. Energetic and vibrant.` |
| **Dance Transfer** | `@Video1 dance choreography. Transfer the dance motion to @Image1 [target character], who is now in a fantasy forest setting. Match the camera movements from @Video1.` |
| **Abstract Visuals** | `@Audio1 track. Abstract ink-in-water visuals pulse and bloom in time with the music. The color palette is black, white, and gold. Slow, hypnotic motion.` |

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Mode:** R2V (with `@Audio1` and/or `@Video1`)
- **Duration:** Match audio clip length (max 15s)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 or 9:16
- **Prompt Length:** 50-80 words

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Lip-sync is still experimental. For dialogue/singing, focus on emotion and general mouth movement, not perfect sync.
- Use the Chinese term `卡点` (kǎdiǎn) for beat-sync; it often works better.
- Keep the visual concept simple to let the music and motion shine.

## 5. Landscape / Travel

**Goal:** Sweeping, beautiful shots of natural and urban environments.

| Template | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Drone Aerial** | `Sweeping aerial drone shot over the Scottish Highlands at dawn. Mist hangs low in the valleys. The camera slowly pulls back to reveal the vast scale of the mountains. Epic and majestic.` |
| **Mountain Dawn** | `The sun rises over a snow-capped mountain peak. Time-lapse style, clouds move quickly. The light changes from cool blue to warm gold. Static wide shot.` |
| **Underwater** | `A school of fish swims through a coral reef. Sunlight filters down through the clear blue water. The camera drifts slowly with the current. Peaceful and serene.` |

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Mode:** T2V
- **Duration:** 8-15 seconds
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
- **Prompt Length:** 30-60 words

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Avoid adding subjects unless necessary. Let the landscape be the hero.
- Use simple, slow camera moves: `slow pan`, `slow aerial pullback`, `static wide shot`.
- Specify the time of day and weather for lighting and mood control (`golden hour`, `stormy sky`, `overcast`).

## 6. Commercial / Brand

**Goal:** Polished, high-end visuals that evoke a specific brand feeling.

| Template | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Car Ad** | `A sleek black sports car drives on a winding mountain road at sunset. The camera tracks alongside the car, low to the ground. Lens flare from the sun. The car looks powerful and luxurious.` |
| **Real Estate** | `A modern, minimalist living room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a forest. The camera slowly pans across the room, showing the clean lines and natural light. Serene and aspirational.` |
| **App Demo** | `A person holds a smartphone, their thumb scrolling through a vibrant, colorful app interface. Close-up on the phone screen. The app looks intuitive and engaging. Bright, clean lighting.` |

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Mode:** T2V or I2V
- **Duration:** 6-10 seconds
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
- **Prompt Length:** 40-70 words

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Do not use real brand names or logos.
- Focus on the *feeling* of the brand (e.g., `luxurious`, `rugged`, `innovative`, `wholesome`).
- Keep the message singular and clear.

## 7. Anime / Artistic

**Goal:** Achieve specific, non-photorealistic visual styles.

| Template | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cel-Shaded Action** | `An anime warrior with white hair, in the style of Studio Trigger. He draws a glowing blue sword. Dynamic low-angle shot. Bold outlines, flat color fills, high-contrast shading. Explosive energy.` |
| **Watercolor Animation** | `A Ghibli-style scene of a girl in a field of flowers. A gentle breeze makes the flowers and her dress sway. Soft, watercolor wash backgrounds and ink outline characters. Dreamy and nostalgic.` |
| **Stop-Motion** | `A claymation character bakes a tiny cake in a cozy kitchen. The animation has a slightly jerky, handmade feel. Visible fingerprints on the clay. Warm, miniature lighting.` |
| **Pixel Art** | `A knight walks through a pixel art forest. 16-bit style. The color palette is limited to greens and browns. The camera is a static side-scroller view.` |

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Mode:** T2V or I2V
- **Duration:** 8-12 seconds
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 or 4:3
- **Prompt Length:** 50-90 words

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Rule #1: One style anchor beats five adjectives.** Instead of `soft dreamy hand-painted`, use `Studio Ghibli watercolor style`.
- Do not use the names of specific copyrighted shows or characters. Reference the *studio* or the *art style*.
- Specify animation techniques like `motion on twos` or `smear frames` for more authentic results.
