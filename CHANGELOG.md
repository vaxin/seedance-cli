## [4.1.0] — 2026-03-02
### Added
- **New `seedance-filter` skill** — Content filter intelligence module. Explains how the Seedance 2.0 content filter evaluates prompts (language-model-based intent assessment, not keyword matching), documents the 37% false-positive block rate, and provides actionable techniques: four-question framework, high-risk word avoidance, image upload best practices, Chinese prompt trick, and professional-language framing.

### Changed
- Root `SKILL.md` version bumped to `4.1.0` with `2026-03-02` date.
- `README.md` updated: version badge `4.1.0`, skill count `23`, Content Quality table includes `seedance-filter`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with this entry.
- `references/quick-ref.md` skill map updated to include `seedance-filter`.

---

## [4.0.0] — 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Cognitive Architecture Upgrade** — Three core skills redesigned using cognitive opcodes inspired by [agi-in-md](https://github.com/Cranot/agi-in-md).
  - `seedance-interview` **L8 Construction-First**: AI builds a "Safe" draft immediately, then asks the user to "attack" it. The user's attack reveals the true creative intent — the "cinematic friction" — which becomes the foundation of the final prompt.
  - `seedance-prompt` **L7 Concealment Check**: Before building a prompt, the AI scans for "concealment words" (beautiful, stunning, epic) that hide a lack of specific visual information. Each is deconstructed and replaced with measurable, observable detail.
  - `seedance-troubleshoot` **L11 Conservation Law**: When a prompt consistently fails, the AI identifies the fundamental trade-off (e.g., Detail × Motion = Constant) and "inverts" the design to find a creative escape route.
- **Storytelling Framework Reference** — Added `references/storytelling-framework.md` with narrative design, visual layering, and director's toolkit principles.

### Changed
- Root `SKILL.md` version bumped to `4.0.0`.
- All 22 sub-skill `SKILL.md` files synchronized to `4.0.0` with `2026-02-28` date.
- `README.md` updated: version badge, skill descriptions, architecture tree, and CHANGELOG reference.

  - `seedance-prompt-short`: New short-form prompt skill with hard 2000-character budget and Compression Engine (4 rules: Verbs > Adjectives, Show Don't Tell, Film Language, Trust the Model).
  - `seedance-interview-short`: New short-form interview skill with live character counter and Director's Notes + Compression Log in final output.
- **Field Note**: Added practitioner note that Seedance V2 performs best with short (<2000 char) Chinese prompts in `README.md` and root `SKILL.md`.
- **README**: New "Two Workflows: Max Detail vs. Max Performance" section with comparison table. Sub-skill count updated to 22.

## [3.7.0] — 2026-02-26
